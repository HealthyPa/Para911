# Intestinal Parasite Cleanse Side Effects – What to Expect with Para911

Worried about side effects during a parasite cleanse? Here’s what you should know when taking Para911.

## 🔄 Common Detox Symptoms (aka Die-Off)

As parasites die, they release toxins that may cause temporary discomfort:

- Mild headaches
- Fatigue or low energy
- Slight nausea
- More frequent bowel movements

These symptoms usually fade within 2–4 days.

## 💧 How to Ease Symptoms

- Stay hydrated  
- Eat clean (avoid sugar and processed foods)  
- Rest during the first few days  
- Use a probiotic after cleansing

## 🧘‍♂️ Who May Experience These Effects?

- First-time users of detox products  
- People with high toxin load  
- Users not drinking enough water

## ✅ Safe for Most Adults

Para911 is made with gentle, natural ingredients. Serious side effects are rare and often linked to pre-existing health conditions or improper use.
